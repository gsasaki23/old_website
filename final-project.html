        <h2>User Research</h2>
        
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;User Interviews</h3>        
        <img id = "screenshot" alt="User Interviews" src="user-interview.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>User interviews are the most straightforward way to understand what users have to say about the website.</li> 
            <li>Most questions that I asked sample users were regarding structure, design, layout, and content.</li>
            <li>Please see <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e2EkdxqJ5VGsG5MYpEd4FKiCMXSL3ygYvResisn_dUA/"> here</a> for a full view of the document.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <img id = "screenshot" alt="Competitor Analysis" src="competitor-analysis.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>A typical competitor analysis in terms of User Research looks at and compares the features and details of other products that serve a similar purpose. I reviewed portfolio websites of other students or developers that are mostly in the Computer Science field. </li>
            <li>Please see <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r5PCPTMumAfMtX6lMbKAY8IsWPQUQmFTB2t4zweVRJg/"> here</a> for a full view the document.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Feature Value Matrix</h3>
        <img id = "screenshot" alt="Feature Value Matrix" src="feature-value-matrix.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>The feature value matrix lists the main features of the website, and calculates the importance of each of them based on user value, business value, and the effort it takes to develop. I selected the five most important features that I felt the website should have.</li>
            <li>Please see <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dcmx1c7rMuJksUqsGkoTl1YzRklCAe8FFF0hK2XZ0eU/"> here</a> for a full view of the matrix.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Feature Prioritization</h3>
        <img id = "screenshot" alt="Feature Prioritization 1" src="feature-prioritization.png"/>
        <img id = "screenshot" alt="Feature Prioritization 2" src="feature-prioritization-chart.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>In the feature prioritization charts I created, I took the features from the Feature Value Matrix (above) and organized them in charts according to their priority. When building the interface of the website, I tried to make the more priority features stand out and easy to locate.</li>
            <li>Please see <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E4jyYHjm54H2MwauEKqUF0cCLHbZusQFxH922O5cyfo/"> here</a> for a full view of the chart.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;User Stories</h3>
        <img id = "screenshot" alt="User Stories" src="user-stories.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>User stories are a type of User Testing that I adapted to get a general understanding of what my users wanted. This was accomplished by comparing my interface with my feature lists, and then looking at my website from the perspective of different types of users.</li>
            <li>Please see <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfoCdW_QTvHf1By98qsDaaMhcBcFYu_ab7RjeG72L-Q/"> here</a> for a full view of the document.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
        <img id = "screenshot" alt="Cognitive Walkthrough" src="cognitive-walkthrough.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>A cognitive walkthrough is a type of User Testing that I adapted to determine if a user can complete a set of tasks walking through a working prototype of my website. It helps to identify issues regarding navigation, content and aesthetics.</li>
            <li>While conducting these, it was rather difficult to not run these like User Interviews where users can throw back any comments back at me, but rather to have the users only do the tasks that I asked them to do.</li>
            <li>Please see <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SfVJzW1Nm59m25hsDAVDVwYZHyj7k5BfuzZQlsRYHxw/"> here</a> for a full view of the document.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Task-Based User Tests</h3>
        <img id = "screenshot" alt="Click Test" src="question-test.png"/>
        <img id = "screenshot" alt="Click Test" src="click-test.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Two User Tests were ran using <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/">UsabilityHub.com</a>.</li>
            
            <li>The first was a question test, which asked how the user would contact the website owner. This checked the functionality and organization of the content of the Contact page. Results show that both the email and phone number were easy to locate.</li>
            <li>The second was a simple click test, which asked where a contact email address would be found from the home page. This looked for two things: 1) To see if the naming of the buttons on the navigation toolbar were appropriate, and 2) To see if it made sense for the contact email to belong on the Contact page. Results show that both were designed correctly.</li>
            <li>Please see <a href = "https://usabilityhub.com/tests/eb6265d31729/results/6ff1fa43cdb3 "> here</a> to view the details of the first test, and <a href = "https://usabilityhub.com/tests/6763bf828f41/results/2ba2185091c0 "> here</a> to view the details of the second test.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary issue that arose from user research and testing was the <em>lack of content and design</em>, which was leading to the website being very <em>boring</em> to look at. Each page was perceived as too plain and bland, especially due to the lack of images throughout the website. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major issue that was raised was the location of the resume. All interviewees agreed that the resume did not belong in the Contact page. One suggestion was to move the image link to another page. Another suggestion was to make it a page of its own with other projects that I have worked on, calling it "Experience" or something along those lines.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last major issue was the Facts page. In general, interviewees were not too impressed with the idea of a button that generates random facts. It was also found that the button did not work on certain browsers such as Firefox. It was suggested to be replaced by the titles of the facts, which could then drop down to show more text and images when clicked.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout conducting user research and tests, as the creator, it was very difficult for me to be biased in my opinions on the website. I found myself constantly trying to defend features and design components while talking to my interviewees. It was very interesting because I did not expect myself to act this way when I was planning out the interview questions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before conducting the user research and testing, I already expected to get negative feedback on the lack of content in general, but I was not expecting the same for the resume and its significance on the website. I also now believe that many of the layout and design choices were from a severe lack of front-end knowledge, rather than poor planning.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
        <ul>Notable changes that have been made to the website since the initial submission include:       
            <li>Adding this "Research" page, which shows and explains the User Research, User Testing, and Summary and Incorporation of Findings since the initial submission.</li>
            <li>Making the website no longer automatically refresh every minute.</li>
            <li>Moving the resume to the now renamed "Interests" page, and showing it on the page instead of just linking to the image.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, I plan to make many changes to the overall design of the website. Many of these changes would come from simply learning more about the coding aspect of websites rather than making better design choices. </p>
        <ul>Major future changes include:             
            <li>Creating a new "Experiences" page, which would include most of my work experience and examples of coding projects that I have worked on. The link to the Resume image would also be moved here.</li>
            <li>Replacing the "Facts" button with another way to display all of the facts, their text, and images. </li>
            <li>Changing the background from a solid blue to some other texture.</li>
            <li>Correcting breakpoints.</li>
        </ul>
